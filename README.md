## Overview

JASSJF is an abbreviation for Just A Super Silly Joke Format.  
The number 100 at the end of JASSJF has no particular meaning.  
It is just a number that was added to avoid tainting search engine results.  

## Parameters

JASSJF100 format requires two pieces of data to be sent: `age` and `passion`.

### Age

The `age` is the sum of the digits of the `format number` displayed on a particular page, multiplied by 10.  
It is never your age.   
For example, if the `format number` is `2022`, then `age` is (2 + 0 + 2 + 2 ) x 10 = `600`.  
Typically, the `format number` may be found in the "console" screen of the browser's developer tools.  
Please use google to find out how to open your browser's developer tools.  

### Passion

The `passion` should be prefixed with `JASSJF100_` so that the total number of characters is 20, and since `JASSJF100_` itself is 10 characters long, you can add any 10 characters after it.  
For example, `JASSJF100_0123456789` is acceptable.  

#### Previous Version

In previous versions, passion had to be prefixed with `passion_`, but the format has changed and only above passion format with `JASSJF100_` is correct.

## Lisence

It is a very silly format and no one will use something like this.  
If by any chance there is someone crazy enough to want to use it, please feel free. No link is necessary.  
I would be too embarrassed to go out if it were known that I was the author of such a stupid format.  


## latest version

If required the latest version of JASSJF100, please add "latest" to the end of the above passion.  
In that case, the total number of characters will be 26.
